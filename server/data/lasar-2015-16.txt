 LASAR  •   5   
unit RequiRementS
Credit for academic work at UCSB is expressed in units. 
The value assigned to a course is determined at the rate of 
one unit for each three hours of student work per week, in-
cluding time in class. In order to be eligible for graduation, 
students must complete at least the following:
• 180 total units (184 if General Education Area B is ful-
filled by completing foreign language level 3 at UCSB 
or its equivalent at another college or university).
• Of the total units, 60 must be upper-division.
There is no limit on the number of courses that may be 
taken passed/not passed during a single quarter. At the 
time of graduation, however, students must have earned at 
least 120, or two-thirds, of their units in residence at UCSB 
on a letter-grade basis. Students who complete more than 
180 units at UCSB must complete at least 120 units on a 
letter-grade basis. (See page 25 for details about the grading 
system at UCSB.)
Course Numbering
Courses at UCSB are identified by their course number as 
lower-division, upper-division, graduate, or professional, as 
follows:
 Classification: Course Numbers: 
 Lower-division 1-99 
 Upper-division 100-199 
 Graduate     200-299; 500-599
 Professional* 300-499
*Professional courses do not apply to the bachelor’s degree
Upper-Division Courses
Sixty upper-division units are required. UCSB courses are 
considered upper-division if they are numbered 100-199. 
Graduate courses numbered 200-299 and 500-599 will ap-
ply to the upper-division unit requirements.
Transfer students from community colleges should take 
particular note of the upper-division unit requirement, 
because community colleges do not offer upper-division 
courses.
Credit Limitations
The university accepts a maximum of 105 quarter units or 
70 semester units of credit for college courses completed 
at two-year colleges or non-UC institutions. Only subject 
credit for specific lower-division requirements is assigned 
subsequently. In addition, graduation credit cannot be as-
signed for:
• Exercise and Sport Studies 1- courses, or their equiva-
lents, in excess of six units. 
• Repetition of courses for which credit has already been 
earned, unless their official descriptions in the General 
Catalog permit repetition for credit. 
• Courses that duplicate material covered in similar 
courses already completed (such as Psychology 5 and 
any course from PSTAT 5AA-ZZ). 
• Lower-division language courses for students who have 
completed ninth grade or higher in a school that uses 
that language for instruction. 
• Foreign language courses at the same level or lower 
level than any such courses already completed. 
• 98/99 and 198/199/199AA-ZZ independent studies 
courses in excess of the 30-unit cumulative limit placed 
upon these classes. 
• University Extension courses numbered other than 1-299. 
• Courses graded F, NP, I, IP, or W at the time of  
graduation. 
• Courses not transferable to the University of California.
• Courses from unaccredited schools.
• UC courses numbered 300-499.
200-Unit Enrollment Limit
The college expects students to graduate with no more than 
200 units. College policy requires students to secure specific 
approval to continue enrollment beyond 200 units. Col-
lege credit earned before high school graduation does not 
count toward the 200-unit maximum. This includes credit 
for Advanced Placement, Cambridge A Level examinations, 
International Baccalaureate examinations, and also college 
or university credit earned while still in high school. In ad-
dition, students who are admitted as freshmen and remain 
continuously enrolled will be allowed 12 regular quarters at 
UCSB, and students admitted as juniors who remain con-
tinuously enrolled will be allowed 6 regular quarters, even if 
they earn more than 200 units during that period. Students 
are also free to attend summer session. Summer session 
does not count as a regular quarter in this calculation, but 
units earned in summer session apply toward the 200-unit 
maximum. 
Note: If students discontinue enrollment at UCSB and earn 
a large number of units at one or more other academic 
institutions while they are away, the number of quarters al-
lowed at UCSB will be reduced in proportion to the number 
of terms completed elsewhere. Students who think they may 
exceed both the quarter limitations noted and 200 units 
may submit a Proposed Schedule for Graduation for consid-
eration by the dean of undergraduate education, but they 
should understand that approval is granted only in very 
limited circumstances. More detail about unit limits is given 
at: www.duels.ucsb.edu/maxunits.

General University Requirements  
Entry Level Writing Requirement
Every undergraduate must demonstrate an acceptable level 
of ability in English composition.
The Entry Level Writing requirement may be met in 
one of seven ways prior to admission: (1) a score of 680 or 
higher on the Writing section of the SAT Reasoning Test 
(or 680 on SAT II Subject Test in writing taken before June, 
2004); (2) a score of 30 on the ACT Combined English/
Writing test; (3) a score of 3 or higher on the College Board 
Advanced Placement Examination in English Composition 
and Literature or English Language and Composition; (4) 
a score of 5, 6, or 7 on the higher level English A Literature 
or English A Language and Literature International Bac-
calaureate Exams; (5) a score of 6 or 7 on the standard level 
English A Literature or English A Language and Literature 
International Baccalaureate Exams; (6) passing the Univer-
sity of California system wide Analytical Writing Placement 
Examination while in high school; (7) entering the universi-
ty with transcripts showing the completion of an acceptable 
three-semester-unit or four-quarter-unit course in English 
composition equivalent to Writing 2 at UCSB with a grade 
of C or higher. Students who have not taken the UC system 
wide examination and who have not satisfied the Entry 
Level Writing requirement in one of the other ways listed 
above will be required to take the UCSB examination dur-
ing their first quarter at UCSB; see the Schedule of Classes 
for examination time and location. A fee will be charged for 
this examination. A passing score on the examination will 
satisfy the Entry Level Writing requirement. Only one UC 
examination may be taken, either the system wide examina-
tion while in high school or the UCSB examination, and 
neither may be repeated.
Students who enter UCSB without having fulfilled the 
university’s Entry Level Writing requirement and who do 
not pass the UCSB examination must enroll in Writing 1 
or 1E or 1LK within their first year at UCSB. A grade of 
C or higher in Writing 1 or 1E or 1LK is needed to satisfy 
the Entry Level Writing requirement. Students who earn a 
grade of C- or lower will be required to repeat the course 
in successive quarters until the requirement is satisfied. 
Students who are required to complete English as a Second 
Language courses may satisfy the Entry Level Writing Re-
quirement with a grade of C or higher in Linguistics 12.
Once students matriculate at UCSB, they may not fulfill 
the requirement by enrolling at another institution. Transfer 
courses equivalent to Writing 2, 2LK, 50, or 50LK will not 
be accepted for unit or subject credit unless the Entry Level 
Writing requirement has previously been satisfied. 
New, nonimmigrant, international students must take a 
special English Language Placement Examination (ELPE) 
when they arrive on campus, unless they have been ex-
empted from this requirement. Students who pass the ELPE 
must satisfy the Entry Level Writing requirement in one 
of the ways described above. Students who do not pass the 
ELPE must enroll in one or more courses in the Depart-
ment of Linguistics that are specifically designed to increase 
oral and/or written proficiency in the English language. 
Performance in these courses will then determine a stu-
dent’s Entry Level Writing status.
The Entry Level Writing requirement must be satisfied 
by the end of the third quarter of matriculation. Students 
who do not meet this deadline will be blocked from further 
enrollment at UCSB. (ESL students should consult the Writ-
ing Program.) 
American History and Institutions  
Requirement
The American History and Institutions requirement is 
based on the principle that students enrolled at an Ameri-
can university should know about the history and govern-
ment of this country. The requirement may be satisfied by 
completion of any four-unit course chosen from the fol-
lowing list. In this context, “course” refers to a one-quarter 
offering such as History 17A or Religious Studies 114B. 
• Anthropology 131, 176B 
• Art History 121A-B-C, 136H 
• Asian American Studies 1, 2
• Black Studies 1, 1H, 6H, 103, 137E,169AR-BR-CR
• Chicano Studies 1A-B-C, 144, 168A-B, 174, 188C
• Comparative Literature 133
• English 133AA-ZZ, 134AA-ZZ, 137A-B, 138C, 191
• Environmental Studies 173 
• Feminist Studies 155A, 159B-C
• History 17A-B-C, 17AH-BH-CH, 105A, 159B-C, 
160A-B, 161A-B, 164C, 164IA, 164IB, 164PR, 165, 
166A-B-C, 166LB, 168A-B, 169AR-BR-CR, 169M, 
172A-B, 173T, 175A-B, 176A-B, 177, 178A-B, 179A-B
• Military Science 27
•  Political Science 12, 115, 127, 151, 152, 153, 155, 
 157, 158, 162, 165, 167, 180, 185
• Religious Studies 7, 14, 114B, 151A-B, 152
• Sociology 137E, 140, 144, 155A, 157
• Theater 180A-B
Courses used to fulfill the American History and Institu-
tions requirement may also be applied to General Education 
and/or major requirements where appropriate. Equivalent 
courses taken at other accredited colleges or universities or 
in UC Extension are acceptable as determined by the Office 
of Admissions.
The American History and Institutions requirement 
may be satisfied in four additional ways: (1) a score of 650 
or higher in the SAT Subject Test in U.S. History; (2) a score 
of 3 or higher on the College Board Advanced Placement 
Examination in American History; (3) a score of 3 or higher 
on the College Board Advanced Placement Examination 
in American Government and Politics; or (4) passing a 
noncredit examination in American history or American 
institutions offered in the Department of History during 
the first week of each quarter (consult the department for 
further information). Students who transfer to UCSB from 
another campus of the University of California where the 
American History and Institutions requirement was con-
sidered satisfied will automatically fulfill the requirement at 
UCSB. International students on a nonimmigrant visa may 
petition for a waiver of this requirement through the direc-
tor of International Students and Scholars.

 LASAR  •   7   
Academic Residence Requirement
Candidates for a bachelor’s degree must be registered in the 
university for at least three terms to fulfill the university’s 
academic residence requirement. A term is a regular quar-
ter or summer session in which a student completes six or 
more units as a registered UCSB student. Each UC summer 
session in which a student completes at least two units but 
fewer than six units is the equivalent of half of a term’s resi-
dence. (In this context, summer session refers to the entire 
summer, not to each mini-session.)
At least 35 of the final 45 units must be taken in the col-
lege or school in which the degree is to be awarded.
Students in the College of Letters and Science must also 
complete at least 27 upper-division units, of which at least 
20 must be in the upper-division major, while in residence 
in the college. In the case of double majors, at least 20 up-
per-division units must be completed in each major while 
in residence in the College of Letters and Science. Courses 
taken in the University’s Education Abroad Program or 
through UC Extension cannot be used to satisfy residence 
requirements. 
Students who wish to receive recognition for completing 
an academic minor must complete at least 12 of the upper-
division units for the minor in residence at UCSB. Students 
who are pursuing a minor or double major should note that 
units applied to residence in one major will not apply to 
residence in the minor or other major.
Coursework completed elsewhere does not apply to aca-
demic residence. This includes courses taken at another UC 
campus while simultaneously enrolled at UCSB. In addi-
tion, UCSB coursework completed through Intersegmental 
Cross Enrollment does not apply to academic residence.
Education Abroad, UCDC, or UC Center 
in Sacramento Program Participants 
With one modification, students who participate in the 
University of California Education Abroad program, UCDC 
program, or UC Center in Sacramento program are respon-
sible for all academic residence requirements as explained 
above. For students who participate in EAP, UCDC, or 
the UC Center in Sacramento program as seniors, the rule 
requiring 35 of the final 45 units in the college or school in 
which the degree is to be awarded is modified to 35 of the 
final 90 units. Students must secure prior approval to use 
this modification and may graduate without returning to 
UCSB provided that they have satisfied all degree require-
ments by the end of their year abroad. Those who have any 
remaining degree requirements must return to UCSB to 
complete a minimum of 12 units on campus while fulfilling 
final degree requirements.
Grade-Point Average  Requirement
At the time of graduation, students in the College of Let-
ters and Science must have at least a 2.0 (C) grade-point 
average in (1) all courses undertaken in the University of 
California except those graded passed/not passed; (2) all 
UC courses required and acceptable for the student’s overall 
major program, both lower- and upper-division; and (3) all 
UC courses required and acceptable for the student’s upper-
division major program.
Courses undertaken at any of the UC campuses in 
regular session or summer session, except for those that ap-
pear exclusively on a UC Extension transcript, are included 
in these grade-point average computations. Effective with 
courses completed in fall 2000 and later, UCSB courses 
completed by concurrent enrollment through Extension 
will be added to students’ UCSB transcripts and integrated 
into the UC grade-point average if degree credit is ap-
proved.
 All courses appropriate for satisfaction of major re-
quirements must be utilized in the computation of the 
grade-point average even if they are in excess of the mini-
mum requirements of the major program. Courses graded 
Incomplete, except those taken on a passed/not passed 
basis, will be included as F grades in final computations. See 
page 26 for details about grades available at UCSB. 
General Education Requirements 
The General Education Program is the common intellectual 
experience of all UCSB students, whatever their majors. 
Through the General Education Program, students receive 
an orientation to a broad range of intellectual disciplines: 
the kinds of questions that are addressed, the methods for 
solving problems, and the strategies for communicating 
findings and conclusions. 
The General Education Program is multidisciplinary. It 
requires study of the humanities and the fine arts, the natu-
ral and social sciences, and the cultural traditions and di-
versity of the modern world. It requires at least one course 
in a world culture and at least one course that focuses on 
the history and cultural, intellectual, and social experience 
of designated U.S. ethnic groups. 
The General Education Program also provides oppor-
tunities to acquire university-level skills in writing, criti-
cal thinking, quantitative analysis, and foreign languages, 
in courses specifically devoted to these topics and also in 
courses in which practice and instruction in these topics are 
embedded in the study of other subjects.
Students in the College of Letters and Science must 
complete the General Education requirements appropri-
ate to their degree (B.A., B.S., B.F.A., or B.M.) in order to 
qualify for graduation. Not all of the General Education 
courses listed in this publication are offered every year.
Students with questions about the General Education 
requirements should meet with an advisor in the College 
of Letters and Science Academic Advising Office in 1117 
Cheadle Hall.  Go to www.duels.edu/advising for hours and 
appointment information. General Provisions Governing All  
Degree Candidates
1. Courses in the student’s major can also be used to 
 fulfill General Education requirements.
2.  Courses taken to satisfy the General Education requirements 
may also be applied simultaneously to the American History 
and Institutions requirement.
3. A course listed in more than one general subject area 
can be applied to only one of these areas. (Example: Art 
History 6A cannot be applied to both E and F.)

Special Subject Area Requirements
In the process of fulfilling the General Education General 
Subject Areas C through G, students must also complete the 
following special subject area requirements. A supplementary 
list of courses applicable to these requirements follows the 
description of General Subject Area Requirements A-G, below.
1. Writing Requirement. At least six designated General Edu-
cation courses that meet the following criteria: Study and 
practice with writing, reading, and critical analysis within 
specific disciplines. Students will demonstrate abilities by 
producing written work totaling at least 1800 words that is 
independent of or in addition to written examinations. As-
sessment of written work must be a significant consideration 
in total assessment of student performance in the course. 
Students may, by petition, request that up to two other UCSB 
courses be considered as applicable toward this requirement. 
Special instructions for such petitions are available from the 
college office. Once a student has matriculated at UCSB, 
the writing requirement may be met only with designated 
UCSB courses. Courses that meet the writing requirement 
are marked with an asterisk (*) symbol in the lists below. 
2. Quantitative Relationships Requirement. Objective: 
To develop and apply basic quantitative methods to rel-
evant questions or areas of study. At least one course from 
Area C emphasizing quantitative relationships. Courses 
applicable to this requirement are marked with a pound 
(#) symbol in Area C below.
3. World Cultures Requirement. Objective: To learn to 
identify, understand, and appreciate the history, thought, 
and practices of one or more culture outside of the Eu-
ropean tradition. At least one course that focuses on a 
world culture outside of the European tradition. Cours-
es applicable to this requirement are marked with a plus 
(+) symbol in Areas D through G below.

 A Level Credit
Students who earn grades of A, B, or C on UC-approved GCE and Hong Kong A Level examinations will receive 12 units of credit 
toward graduation at UCSB for each exam, provided that official grades are submitted to the Office of Admissions.  Any general 
education credit or UCSB course equivalents listed in the chart below will be awarded only for Cambridge International A Level 
exams taken in 2013 or later, not for exams administered by any other agency. (Student may petition for GE or course credit for 
Cambridge International exams taken prior to 2013 or for exams administered by other agencies.) 
Students should be advised that college courses taken before or after attending UC may duplicate AP, IB and/or A Level examina-
tions. Additionally, exams may duplicate each other (for example, an AP or IB exam in the same subject area). If the student does 
duplicate an exam with another exam of the same subject content, and/or an exam with a college course, we will award credit only 
once. 
Note: A Level examination credit earned prior to entering the university will not be counted toward maximum unit limitation either 
for selection of a major or for graduation.

mAjoR RequiRementS
In order to be eligible for graduation, all undergraduates 
must complete the requirements for a major in the College 
of Letters and Science with the required grade-point 
averages and academic residence requirements. To ensure 
timely progress toward the degree, students are required to 
declare their major by the time they reach 90 units. 
Provided they will be able to complete the degree 
requirements without exceeding 200 units, students may 
elect any approved major program for which they have met 
the stated prerequisites, as space permits. Students from the 
College of Engineering and the College of Creative Studies 
will not be accepted into the College of Letters and Science 
after they have completed 180 units. Major departments 
and/or committees may require auditions, placement 
examinations, or specified courses to determine whether 
students are qualified for entrance into or continuation 
in a major. Admission into the individual major and the 
interdisciplinary studies major is subject to the approval 
of the Executive Committee of the College of Letters and 
Science. In addition, some departments require a grade-
point average in excess of 2.0 for entrance into the major, as 
noted in the General Catalog. Students who fail to maintain 
a grade-point average of at least 2.0 in work in the major 
may, at the option of the major department or committee, be 
denied the privilege of continuing in that major.
Students in the College of Letters and Science normally 
complete the major requirements in effect at the time they 
declare their major, though they may petition to follow a 
subsequent set of requirements.
Changes in major requirements that increase the number 
or specificity of courses required will not normally be applied 
to already-declared students continuing in such majors. 
However, if students take one or more breaks in enrollments 
totaling nine or more quarters, they may be required to 
follow a newer catalog year upon their final return to UCSB.
Full details are described in the UCSB General Catalog.
enRoLLment AnD gRADing
enRoLLment
Each quarter, every student at UCSB must register in 
courses, clear any blocks on registration, and pay fees and 
other outstanding financial obligations. Additionally, each 
fall quarter, every student must confirm or update address 
information either through the GOLD system on the web at 
my.sa.ucsb.edu/gold/login.aspx or with a Change of Address 
petition. Each step must be completed by specified dead-
lines. The failure of an undergraduate student to complete 
the steps involved in enrollment by the specified deadlines 
will constitute presumptive evidence that the student has 
withdrawn from the university. A student whose status has 
lapsed because of failure to satisfy the conditions of admis-
sion, failure to register, failure to clear blocks, or failure 
to meet financial obligations, and who wishes to resume 
studies, must file an application for readmission/reinstate-
ment and pay the associated nonrefundable fee. Readmis-
sion/reinstatement is subject to availability of space and is 
not guaranteed. Check registrar.sa.ucsb.edu for applicable 
deadlines. 
Program Changes
After registration, changes in the student’s program can be 
made using GOLD until the deadlines published on the 
Registrar website, registrar.sa.ucsb.edu, for each quarter. 
Such changes include course drops and adds and change in 
grading options. Unapproved withdrawal from or neglect of 
a course for which one has registered will result in a failing 
grade. Course additions after the first week of classes require 
the approval of the course instructor.
      Program Change Deadlines
 Last Day to: 
Drop Writing 1, 1E, 1LK, 2,  5th day of classes

Add classes 15th day of classes
Drop classes (other than  20th day of classes writing courses listed above)
Change grading option End of the 7th   week of classes
Maximum and Minimum Programs
The average academic study load for undergraduate students 
is 15 units per quarter, to yield 180 units by the time of grad-
uation. The minimum full-time study load is 12 units, but 
students will not graduate in four years if they enroll in the 
minimum number of units each quarter. Students who are 
not able to carry at least 12 units per quarter must petition 
and receive approval prior to enrolling in a deficit program. 
Undergraduate students who have submitted their petitions 
to the College of Letters and Science for a deficit program of 
10 or fewer units prior to the first day of instruction may be 
considered for a 50 percent reduction of the educational fee 
and nonresident tuition, subject to approval of the Office of 
Student Life. Only those students with verifiable reasons of 
employment, health, or family responsibility will be eligible 
for the fee reduction. Deficit program approval does not 
constitute automatic approval of fee reduction. Students in 
the College of Letters and Science may petition for perma-
nent approval of deficit programs (that is, for permanent 
part-time status). 
Students in good academic standing may enroll in as 
many as 21 units each quarter. Those on academic probation 
may not enroll in more than 17 units each quarter of their 
probationary status. Students who wish to enroll in more 
than the maximum number of allowable units must petition 
for an excess program at the time of registration.

Minimum Cumulative Progress  
(MCP) Program
Undergraduate students enrolled in the College of Letters 
and Science are subject to the Minimum Cumulative Prog-
ress requirement. Minimum Cumulative Progress (MCP) 
is a policy designed and approved by the faculty to provide 
important guideposts to ensure timely degree completion. 
The MCP requirement establishes a reasonable expectation 
of student workload. For more information concerning 
MCP requirements refer to: 
www.duels.ucsb.edu/advising/mcp.
Summary of Program Regulations
Certain rules govern the selection of courses each term. 
Students are reminded that they: 
• May not enroll in a course officially as a way of mak-
ing up an Incomplete grade. 
• May not enroll in more than five total units of 98, 99, 
198, 199, 199AA-ZZ courses per quarter. 
• Must be juniors or seniors to enroll in 198 or 199, 
199AA-ZZ courses. 
• Must choose letter grading for all courses used to 
satisfy requirements in the major or minor. This in-
cludes lower- and upper-division courses, both within 
and outside the department of the major or minor. 
(Some departments accept a small number of units for 
courses graded P where letter grades are not available. 
See departmental entries in the General Catalog.)
• May not repeat a course for which the previous grade 
was higher than C- unless permitted in the official 
course description in the General Catalog.
• Must obtain permission of the dean to repeat a course 
that they have already attempted two or more times.
• Must complete Writing 1, 1E, or 1LK by the end of the 
third quarter at UCSB. 
• Must complete Writing 2, 2E, or 2LK by the end of the 
sixth quarter at UCSB. 
Student Responsibilities
Students are responsible for the following:
1. Verifying eligibility for classes. Students should consult 
the General Catalog for prerequisites.
2.  Avoiding duplicating coursework for which they have  
already earned credit.
3. Indicating their desired grading option at the time of 
enrollment.
4. Observing and meeting all deadlines for fee payment, 
registration, and changing their enrollment (adding or 
dropping courses, changing grading option).
5. Indicating course repetition at the time of enrollment.
6. Indicating the intended number of units to be earned in 
variable-unit courses. At the end of the term, the instruc-
tor will report to the Office of the Registrar the number 
actually completed and the grade earned, and the Office 
of Registrar will make any necessary adjustments to the 
student record.
7. Obtaining approval prior to registration for any of the 
following exceptions:
• enrolling in a deficit program of fewer than 12 units. 
Required fall, winter, and spring only; for summer 
session there is no minimum load requirement.
• enrolling in more than 17 units while on academic 
probation in fall, winter, and spring quarters. 
• enrolling in more than 21 units while in good aca-
demic standing. Required fall, winter, and spring. 
•  enrolling in an excess program of more than 16 units 
during each summer session. 
• enrolling in UC Extension courses.
•  enrolling simultaneously at UCSB and another col-
lege or university (concurrent enrollment). Note that 
degree credit for such transfer work is very rarely 
approved.
• repeating a course more than once. 
• exceptions to 198, 199, 199AA-ZZ course policies.
AbSence, WithDRAWAL, AnD  
ReADmiSSion/ReinStAtement
Temporary Absence During a Quarter
Students are expected to attend classes regularly, and in 
most instances attendance and participation in class are 
factors in determining the final grade. If an absence is un-
avoidable due to serious illness or personal emergency, each 
instructor should be notified. Regardless of the reasons for 
absence, however, students will be required to complete all 
coursework.
If an absence is late in the term and prolonged, making 
it impossible to complete the coursework on time, students 
may petition their instructors to assign an Incomplete (I) 
grade. To receive an I grade, a student must submit the ap-
proved petition to the Office of the Registrar by the last day 
of the quarter in which the I is to be assigned. A $5 fee will 
be assessed. A student who is unable to make this request in 
person may ask the Office of Student Life to notify each in-
structor of the circumstances of the absence and to circulate 
a petition on the student’s behalf. If the instructor agrees 
that an extension of time for completion of the course is 
justified and approves the petition, a grade of Incomplete 
will be assigned. See page 28 for complete details about 
Incomplete grades.

 LASAR  •   27   
Withdrawal from a Course
To drop a course after the established deadline for each 
quarter, undergraduates must make a written request and 
obtain the approval of the dean of undergraduate education. 
Such requests are not readily approved, and students should 
continue attendance while the request is evaluated. If the 
request is approved, the dean will direct the Office of the 
Registrar to enter the grade of W for each course involved. 
If the request is not approved, the student will receive the 
grade assigned by the instructor of the course.  
Complete Withdrawal
Once fees have been paid or officially deferred, or after a 
financial aid agreement has been signed for a particular 
quarter, students then wishing to withdraw for that term 
without completing the enrollment process must do so by 
petition to the Office of the Registrar. An enrolled stu-
dent who wishes to withdraw from the university during a 
quarter without completing the quarter’s work must obtain 
a petition for complete withdrawal from the Office of the 
Registrar. If the petition requirements are met and the ap-
proval of the dean of undergraduate education is secured, 
and if the completed petition is submitted to the Office of 
the Registrar by the deadline for course withdrawal, the 
student’s registration will be cancelled without academic 
penalty. If the completed petition is submitted to the Office 
of the Registrar after the deadline for course withdrawal, 
but no later than the last day of instruction for the term, 
the dean of undergraduate education will direct the Office 
of the Registrar to enter the grade of W for each course in 
which the student was enrolled. A student who receives 
permission to withdraw completely during the early weeks 
of a quarter may be entitled to a partial refund of fees for 
that quarter as outlined one the Registrar website, registrar.
sa.ucsb.edu. Students who have received Title IV federal 
aid will be required to return a portion of that aid if they 
withdraw before completing 60 percent of the quarter. 
Upon request, the Office of Student Life will process a peti-
tion for complete withdrawal, but no later than the last day 
of instruction for the term, for a student who cannot do so 
in person. If the dean of undergraduate education approves 
the petition, the student’s academic record will reflect the 
process described above. 
Students who enroll and subsequently discontinue work 
during a quarter without an approved petition for withdraw-
al will receive F or NP grades, as appropriate, for all courses 
in which they are enrolled for that quarter. Such students are 
ineligible for any refund of fees, and their future registration 
privileges may be curtailed or revoked. Students are advised 
to seek counsel from faculty, departmental, or college advi-
sors, Counseling Services, Career Services, and the Financial 
Aid Office, if appropriate, before withdrawing to consider 
the full implications of this action. After withdrawal and 
before future registration, undergraduates must apply for 
and receive permission to be readmitted. 
Note: The deadline to submit a petition for complete with-
drawal is the last day of instruction for the term.
gRADeS
Grading System
The College of Letters and Science offers two grading op-
tions for undergraduates: letter grades A-F and passed/not 
passed (P/NP) grades. Any grade of D- or above is consid-
ered a passing grade in letter-graded courses. There is no 
stipulation (such as a mandatory grade curve) concerning 
how these grades should be distributed in each class; this 
is left to the discretion of the instructor. Instructors may 
modify the grades of A, B, C, and D by assigning a plus (+) 
or a minus (-) suffix. Minus grades carry three-tenths of a 
grade point less per unit, and plus grades (except A+) carry 
an additional three-tenths of a grade point per unit. When a 
student withdraws from the university or receives approval 
to drop a course after the established deadline for course 
withdrawal (20th day of instruction), the registrar will as-
sign a W to the student for each course affected. Courses in 
which a W has been entered on the student’s record will be 
disregarded in determining a student’s grade-point average. 
Grade-Point Average
The university grade-point average is computed by dividing 
the number of units attempted on a letter-grade basis in the 
University of California into the number of grade points 
earned for these units. Grade-point averages are computed 
for a number of purposes, including the determination of 
whether students are (1) maintaining the averages required 
for continued registration in the university, (2) eligible to 
enter or continue in a given course or major, (3) eligible for 
graduation, and (4) eligible for honors such as member-
ship in the College Honors Program, dean’s term honors, or 
honors at graduation.
Graduate and professional schools, as well as employers, 
may compute grade-point averages differently. For example, 
they may include only the classes completed during the 
junior and senior years, or only courses completed in the 
major department. Pre-law students should note that the 
Law School Data Admission Service (LSDAS) computes 
grades of NP as F in the GPA.
Grade-Point Balance
The grade-point balance is the difference between the 
number of grade points which a student has earned and the 
number needed for a 2.0 grade-point average. 
The first step in computing the grade-point balance is to 
multiply the number of units attempted for letter grade by a 
factor of 2, to determine the number of grade points needed 
for a 2.0 grade-point average. To find their grade-point bal-
ance, students then subtract this number from the number 
of grade points they have actually earned. Students whose 
grade-point average is above 2.0 will have a positive grade-
point balance. Those with a grade-point average of exactly 
2.0 will have a 0 balance. Students whose grade-point aver-
age is below 2.0 will have a negative balance, called a deficit.
----------------Page (26) Break----------------
28  •  LASAR
Computation of grade-point 
balance is especially helpful to 
students who are in academic 
difficulty, for it aids in deter-
mining how long it will take, 
and what grades are needed, 
to return to regular academic 
status. For example, to coun-
teract a grade-point deficit of 
eight, a student will need to 
earn eight grade points above 
the C level. This would be ac-
complished by earning eight units of B or four units of A. 
Visit www.duels.ucsb.edu/advising/gpbcalc.php for 
practice in calculating grade-point average and balance.

Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) grades are not included in the 
computation of university grade-point averages. Courses 
graded P, however, are acceptable for unit and appropriate 
degree credit. P grades will be assigned only for coursework 
equivalent to a C or better on the letter-grade basis. NP 
grades will be assigned for work equivalent to a C- or below. 
No unit or degree credit is given for courses graded NP. 
Undergraduate courses may be offered exclusively on a P/
NP basis with the prior approval of the appropriate faculty 
committees. Such courses are specially identified in GOLD. 
Students on academic probation, as well as those in good 
standing, may take such courses without special approval. 
Students may elect the P/NP grading option in any number 
of courses (see GOLD to determine which courses allow the 
P/NP grading option) during a particular term provided 
that: 
• They are in good academic standing (i.e., not on 
academic probation). However, students on probation 
may enroll in courses offered exclusively on a P/NP 
basis. 
• The course is open to all qualified students on this 
basis and is so advertised in GOLD. 
• The course is not required or accepted for the stu-
dent’s major or minor. Courses in the major or minor, 
whether lower- or upper-division, in or outside of the 
major department, must be taken for a letter grade. 
(With the prior approval of appropriate faculty com-
mittees, a department may specify that certain major 
or minor courses may be taken P/NP. Courses for 
which such approval has been granted are identified in 
the department entries in the General Catalog.) 
• They elect this option at the time of registration or 
thereafter but not later than the end of the seventh 
week of classes. Students are responsible for deter-
mining whether they are qualified for enrollment in 
courses on a P/NP basis according to the requirements 
stated here.
• At the time of graduation at least two-thirds of their 
units earned in residence at UCSB have been earned 
on a letter-grade basis. (Students who complete more 
than 180 units at UCSB must complete at least 120 
letter-graded units in residence.) There is no limit on 
the number of courses which may be taken P/NP by 
eligible students during a single quarter.
• They have not been restricted or prohibited from the 
use of the P/NP option due to an excessive number 
of NP grades earned. Students with more than eight 
units of NP grades in one quarter or with more than 
20 units of NP grades in all terms of university enroll-
ment combined may be so restricted. In the case of 
repeated courses in which the initial grade was NP, the 
original NP will not be included in this 20-unit total. 
Students who take major or minor courses in excess of 
minimum major or minor requirements may elect the P/NP 
option for those courses. Such courses will not be accepted 
in satisfaction of requirements for the major or minor. Stu-
dents who plan to apply to graduate or professional schools 
should use P/NP grading sparingly, as it provides less 
information for admissions committees to review. Pre-law 
students should note that the Law School Data Assembly 
Service (LSDAS) will calculate an NP grade as an F when 
considering applicants for admission into their programs.
Incomplete Grade
The grade Incomplete (I) may be assigned when a student’s 
work is of passing quality but is incomplete. I grades will be 
excluded in the computation of the student’s grade-point 
average at the end of the quarter. 
Petitioning Process
An I grade may be placed on a student’s record only if the 
completed Petition for an Incomplete Grade, signed by the 
instructor, is on file in the Office of the Registrar by the last 
day of the quarter. The student’s BARC account is billed 
for the processing fee. In the absence of the petition or of a 
specific grade other than I, the Office of the Registrar will 
record a grade of F, NP, or U.
Letter Grades 
A =  Excellent  
B =  Good 
C =   Adequate  
D =  Barely Passing 
F =  Failing 
I =  Incomplete 
IP =  In Progress 
W =   Withdrawal
A+ 4.0 D 1.0 
A 4.0   D - 0.7 
A - 3.7 F 0.0 
B+ 3.3 I 0.0 
B 3.0 IP 0.0 
B - 2.7 P 0.0 
C+ 2.3  NP 0.0 
C  2.0 S 0.0 
C - 1.7 U 0.0 
D+ 1.3 W 0.0
 Each    =   Grade   Each    =  Grade unit of       Points  unit of      Points

Completion Deadline
The deadline to complete an I grade is the end of the term 
following the term in which the I grade was reported, 
whether or not the student is registered and whether or not 
the course is offered in that term. The student is entitled to 
have the grade of Incomplete replaced by a passing grade 
as determined by the instructor concerned, and to receive 
unit credit and appropriate grade points, upon satisfactory 
completion of the coursework by this deadline. Unless the 
work is completed and a grade is reported to the Office of 
the Registrar by the deadline, the I will be changed auto-
matically to F, NP, or U, as appropriate. If the instructor 
is unavailable, the chair of the department in which the 
course was offered is authorized to supervise completion 
of the work and to make the appropriate grade change. 
The instructor and chair also have the authority to extend 
the deadline for completion in the event of unusual cir-
cumstances that would clearly impose an unfair hardship 
on the student if the original deadline were maintained. 
At the time of graduation, an I grade on the student’s 
record in a course necessary for the fulfillment of degree 
requirements will disqualify the student for graduation. 
An I grade on the student’s record at the time of gradua-
tion in a course not necessary for the fulfillment of degree 
requirements may be removed only up to the end of the 
fifth week of the term following the date of graduation. If 
not removed, it will remain an I on the record permanently. 
For the purpose of determining academic eligibility, any 
I grades remaining on the record at the time of gradua-
tion will be counted as F grades in the computation of the 
required university grade-point average if the student has 
elected the letter-grade option.
Grade Changes to Incomplete 
A grade may be changed to an I only with the approval of 
the dean of undergraduate education and after successful 
completion of the petitioning process described above.
In-Progress Grade
The grade In Progress (IP) may be assigned provisionally 
in each but the last term of special courses extending over 
more than one term. In the last term, the grade assigned by 
the instructor replaces the provisional IP grades for all por-
tions of the course. If a student fails to enroll in or complete 
the final course of a sequence in the next quarter in which 
it is offered, the IP grades will be replaced by the grade of I. 
Further changes of that grade will be subject to the condi-
tions covering incomplete grades. IP designations are not 
included in the computation of grade-point averages. 
Withdrawal Grade
The W grade will be assigned when a student withdraws 
from the university or receives permission to drop a 
course after the deadline for course withdrawal set by the 
executive committee of the college or school in which the 
student is enrolled. (This includes undergraduate enroll-
ment in graduate-level courses.) The W grade will be as-
signed for each course affected. Courses in which a W has 
been entered on the student’s record will be disregarded in 
determining a student’s grade-point average and will not 
be considered as courses attempted in assessing the stu-
dent’s grade-point average for graduation.
