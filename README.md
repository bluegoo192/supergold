## IMPORTANT

Chrome doesn't trust self-signed certificates by default.  In order to get this extension to work, open https://localhost:3000 while the server is running.  DON'T FORGET TO USE HTTPS, NOT HTTP.  Tell Chrome to trust the certificate and you should be ready to use the extension.

Also, I've removed node_modules to improve git performance.  This means that after a git pull, you might not be able to run the server.  If this happens, just do npm install
